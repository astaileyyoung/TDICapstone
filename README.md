# TDICapstone
I completed this project for the capstone in the Data Analytics course from The Data Incubator. Taking a large sample of Hollywood films made between 1915 and 1970, I examine how what I term the "exterior rate" (the percentage of total frames that are outdoors) changed over historical period under examination. 

This repo includes a Jupyter Notebook containing all the code used in my analysis. 

I have written a series of posts on Medium about this project, which can be found here: https://medium.com/@amosstaileyyoung/list/using-mits-places365-to-track-location-shooting-in-americancinema-e9a4a1b346c6

This project came out of my dissertation, "On Location in Nature's Studio: Toward a Social History of Hollywood Filmmaking in the American West." For those interested, the dissertation can be found on my Academia.edu page: https://uiowa.academia.edu/AmosStaileyYoung
